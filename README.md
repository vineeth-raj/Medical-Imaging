# Medical-Imaging

## Purpose
1. This repository contains our learnings while working medical imaging datasets using Pytorch and other libraries
2. While learning we found it very difficult where to start and what direction to take as there is an information bubble out there. Lot of good work including papers/github repo/libraries are there and lot of beginners get confused on how to proceed. We hope ths repo will help new learners by giving them some direction on how to go about exploring medical imaging
