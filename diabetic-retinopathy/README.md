## Prerequisite - 
* One of the good beginner problem to start with in semantic segmentation space/image procesing space
* Since data is 2D and competition is a bit older we can get lots of references to kickstart
 
## Problem

[Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection)

Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. 
It is estimated to affect over 93 million people.

## Approach 
As our first problem while learning basic image processing, we have tired to identify the factors that cause DR from the images. 
As a next step the project can be extended to build a classification model to predict whether person has DR or not
